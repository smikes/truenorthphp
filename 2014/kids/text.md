# Teaching Programming to Kids

## Hook

I have this vision of what retirement might be like.  I'll be sitting on a beach, someplace warm and sunny...

[Visual of stereotypical caribbean beach]

sipping on some sort of adult beverage, just feeling the breeze and watching the waves go by...

[cell phone ringing sound]

Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.  Is it OK if I just get this?  Thanks.

[Turn sideways to audience and pretend to be taking phone call.]

> Hello?  Yes, hi.  I'm actually in the middle of something right now.
> The payments system? Uh-huh... and did you talk to .. uh-huh.
> Well I'll call you back when I can get to a keyboard, OK?
> Bye.

[Turn back to audience]

And unfortunately I think that's what "retirement" is going to be like for a lot of us because it's
so hard to find good programmers.  And it's hard to train programmers industrially, with the school 
system in way we have developed to teach elementary skills (such as reading) and mechanical skills
(such as welding, or operating a lathe).

I'm not knocking school - I've spent a lot of time in school - but I think experience bears this out
that for more than 60 years we've been trying to teach programming in schools.  And we still haven't
gotten very good at it.

## Intro - Map

So I want to talk today about WHY we need to do this, show you at a high level HOW this
works, and finally give you some TIPS and approaches, to give you some
ideas about WHAT you can do to teach programming.

I've left some time for questions at the end - this talk runs about 40 minutes - so if
you think of a question or comment as I'm talking please hold on to it, or make a note of it,
because we *WILL* have time for it later.

And my goal in this talk is to inspire you to want to go out and teach programming,
in your own time, to someone.
