# Teaching Programming to Kids

## Hook

I have this vision of what retirement might be like.  I'll be sitting on a beach, someplace warm and sunny...

Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.  Is it OK if I just get this?  Thanks.

[Turn sideways to audience and pretend to be taking phone call.]

> Hello?  Yes, hi.  I'm actually in the middle of something right now.
> The payments system? Uh-huh... and did you talk to .. uh-huh.
> Well I'll call you back when I can get to a keyboard, OK?
> Bye.

[Turn back to audience]

And unfortunately I think that's what "retirement" is going to be like for a lot of us because it's
so hard to find good programmers.  And it's hard to train programmers industrially, with the school
system in way we have developed to teach elementary skills (such as reading) and mechanical skills
(such as welding, or operating a lathe).

I'm not knocking school - I've spent a lot of time in school - but I think experience bears this out
that for more than 60 years we've been trying to teach programming in schools.  And we still haven't
gotten very good at it.

## Intro - Map

So I want to talk today about WHY we need to do this, show you at a high level HOW this
works, and finally give you some TIPS and approaches, to give you some
ideas about WHAT you can do to teach programming.

I've left some time for questions at the end - this talk runs about 40 minutes - so if
you think of a question or comment as I'm talking please hold on to it, or make a note of it,
because we *WILL* have time for it later.

And my goal in this talk is to inspire you to want to go out and teach programming,
in your own time, to someone.

## Section1 - WHY

%NEEDSTATS

I've already alluded to one reason WHY we need to train more programmers --
because we, as a generation of programmers, need to replace ourselves before
we retire.  In fact we need to more than replace ourselves -- the rate of
growth in programming jobs is X.  The average programming career is Y years (?20 years)
then on average we each need to train between 2 and 4 (2.71) people to
keep up with growth.

This is not a problem than can be "solved" by outsourcing.  For the last 20
years -- my entire career -- I've been hearing that programming jobs are going
away to India or China or Bangladesh.  And although those places have
seen growth in programming jobs, demand is still high here.

At least two factors feed into that.  First is that software has a strong
cultural component.  Now this cuts both ways -- both in that people from
culture A are less effective at writing software for culture B than
people who are  native to culture B.  And also as these countries
we were trying to outsource to are getting wealthier, they're generating
more demand for software, so programmers are enticed away from outsourcing
jobs; and are making software for their own culture -- Mandarin, or Cantonese
or Bengali.

Second, we've already tapped some of the most populated areas of the world
for programmers, so there's just not many more places to outsource to.
(Until we revive the space program.)

And I should also mention that one area where outsourcing is not
relevant is in "insourcing" -- in bringing people into programming who
do not have the traditional background, who are bringing new ideas and
viewpoints to the field.

For example I have a few friends who have a product which automatically
customizes knitting patterns to a person's measurements and body shape.
that's not an application I would have thought of, but it has some
interesting math, 3D modeling, and other technical stuff.

That's it for diversity in this talk; it's something I find
interesting but I don't have anything particularly valuable to add.
But if you'd like to talk or argue about it later, please find me
afterwards.

But the most important reason, I think, is because of this---

A lot of technology available today is targeted towards USERS.  And while
there's nothing wrong with being only a "user" of technology -- like right
now, we are just "users" of the electricity, and this laser, etc. --
we need to have people who are also designers and builders of new
technology.

A lot of courses focus on -- and are quite good at -- how to USE a
program or a tool; such as Final Cut or PowerPoint or Garage Band.

And that's find; it's important for those courses to exist.  But as we've
seen in open source, there's a lot to be gained in having a vibrant
community of builders and designers making new things, new software
libraries and so on.

So I hope I've convinced you WHY we need to train new programmers.
Now I'm going to show you HOW someone becomes the kind of programmer
I'm talking about.

[insert MOAR (some signposts about)]

Now a brief digression.  Are you familiar with the concept of "flow"
from the discipline of positive psychology?

A "flow" state is characterized by

  - a feeling of challenge, of work at an appropriate level of difficulty

  - a feeling of competence, that your skill is equal to the work to be done

  - a "loss of self" - a diminished perception of your environment and
    your own body

This is also called being "in the zone", or if you're a musician,
"in the groove", or "being on"; or "on your game".

And just a quick check, a quick show of hands: How many of the people in the
room have ever felt that - ever in your life? [Most of the room, I hope!]

And how many have ever had that feeling, while programming?  Or doing
that sort of creative, yet technical work? [Again, hopefully, most of the room]

Good, I'm glad to see that.

Flow is one of the best things - one of the most pleasant experiences a
human being can have.  And it's good for you, too -- flow was
discovered almost by accident by a fellow named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

He grew up in Hungary, and lived through the second world war as a
child.  As an adult he observed that for some people the war was a
shattering experience.  They were never able to live normally again.  But
for others, they were able to bounce back, and live mostly normal lives
afterwards.  So he began to sudy what the difference was, what was the
protective factor, and that's how he discovered flow.

It's not a magic bullet of course.  Being able to get into flow
doesn't solve the rest of your problems.

Now what *is* flow? And how does it work?

I'm going to simplify and say it's basically a bug in how our brains
work.  Csikszentmihalyi has measured how much attention we have, how much
information we can pay attention to, and it's about 125 bits per second.
(That's only slightly more than an old-style acoustic coupler modem,
which had 110 baud)

Now for example listening to someone speak, that's about 40 bits/second.
so following two speakers, even at once, is within most people's ability.
But listening to three people, all talking at one is over the limit for most
people.

That's because some of this capacity for attention is taken up by baseline
activities of your mind and body.  Things like, my nose itches; when is lunch?;
and thinking about your relationships with the other people in your life.

But sometimes if the conditions are right...
